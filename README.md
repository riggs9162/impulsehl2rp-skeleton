# Welcome to impulse: HL2 RP Skeleton Schema
This repository contains basic Half-Life 2 Roleplay files to use impulse framework or the impulse Enhanced framework. * Keep in mind that this Schema is* **unfinished!**

## Installation, assuming you know how to code, rename the folder witih the gamemodes folder from **impulsehl2rp-skeleton**, to **impulsehl2rp**.

## impulse
[impulse](https://github.com/aLoneWitness/impulse) is a Semi-Serious roleplay framework for Garry's Mod.

## impulse: Enhanced
[impulse: Enhanced](https://github.com/impulseenhanced/framework) is a fork, unofficial maintained version of impulse.

## Note
It's recommended to advise against using any Landis Code, it can harm you with legal troubles and most likely is filled with backdoors. Stick to the linked ones instead. Also don't use leaked code, it's shit either way.
